# Utility Scripts Repository

A collection of scripts and tools I use for system administration, development, and automation tasks. These scripts are designed to simplify repetitive tasks, enhance system security, and streamline workflows.

## Repository Structure

- **`scripts/`**: Contains executable scripts for various tasks.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation files explaining specific configurations, setups, or usage guides.
- **`reports/`**: Generated reports from scripts (e.g., installed packages, system diagnostics).
- **`configs/`**: Configuration files for tools or environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Bash shell (`bash >= 4.0`)
- GNU utilities (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`, etc.)
- For some scripts, ensure `sudo` permissions.

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/utility-scripts.git
cd utility-scripts
